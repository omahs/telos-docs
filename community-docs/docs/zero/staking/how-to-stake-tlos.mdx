# How to stake TLOS: A simple guide with FAQs

TLOS is the native coin of the Telos Blockchain. You can stake your TLOS coins and earn interest/returns/profits automatically compounded every 30 minutes. The rewards come from a community reserve and are distributed to those who stake their TLOS to REX.

The process to stake TLOS to REX is simple. You need to have TLOS on the Telos Blockchain to start.

If you don’t have a Telos account, follow these simple steps. 

There are multiple interfaces to stake TLOS, of which the Open Block Explorer is the primary method. This article shows the process to stake using the most preferred methods.
