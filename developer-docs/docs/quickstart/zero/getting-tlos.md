# Funding Your Wallet

The TLOS token is both the governance and resource token of the Telos network and is used for voting on network wide governance ballots, managing transaction quota and purchasing RAM.

## Bridging From Other Chains

TLOS is the native coin of the Telos blockchain (like ETH is for Ethereum, BNB is for Binance Smart Chain). TLOS now exists on three blockchains – Telos, Ethereum and BSC. While TLOS is fundamentally used on the Telos blockchain, it is also added on other blockchains for reasons such as liquidity and exposure. They’re pegged 1:1 which means that 1 TLOS on Telos is the same as 1 TLOS on Ethererum (erc20) and BSC (bep20). You can bridge/transfer TLOS between blockchains as per your convenience and needs.

This article describes the two primary methods used to bridge TLOS. You will need a TLOS account.

Due to current circumstances we advise against using the Multichain bridge detailed in the article below. There are still other protocols available to bridge to/from Telos.

From what users report, the RocketX bridge has been performing the best and pTokens has been having issues.
