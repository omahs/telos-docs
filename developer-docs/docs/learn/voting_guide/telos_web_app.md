Following Signers/Wallets are currently supported:
- Anchor Wallet
- Cleos (advanced user command line, not be covered in this article)

#### Log in with Anchor Wallet   
While other options are available, we are focusing on Anchor for this tutorial.  

- After you click the Anchor icon, it will prompt you to Launch Anchor.  
- Once you launch Anchor, there will be an identity request sent. Sign the identity request in your wallet that pops up then you will be logged in. Please note that both the Anchor desktop and mobile wallets are supported.

- __NOTE:__ In very rare cases, you may need to reset/reboot your Anchor wallet if there is no signing request.

__Please note:__ If your account is “fresh” or you are missing required resources, this may result in an error message. Please refer to [How to manage RAM](../../zero/resource-management/ram.md) and [How to manage CPU and NET](../../zero/resource-management/cpu-net.md). This will resolve the issues in most instances.

#### Click on proposals in the top menue

This is the section where all proposals are launched and voted on by participants with their TLOS!

__Join DAO (Group).__

If you are not yet a DAO (Group) member owning the proposal you wish to vote for, you can join by selecting "JOIN DAO first." Please approve the transaction. You are now a member of the DAO and all set to participate in the Telos governance!

After clicking vote, it will prompt you to sign the transaction to cast a vote.

__Now that you can vote and participate in Telos Goverance. Take action and enjoy Digital Freedom!!__

#### Click “DAOs” to Register as a Voter (optional)

The Telos Decide engine supports various entities and groups, also called DAOs, that can utilize our governance tools for their purpose. The flexibility makes it a preferred tool for DAOs or projects that would like to hear a community voice.

You can register for a "DAO" without any active proposal based on the following instruction.

__Due to this great functionality, you will have to join the “Telos Governance Token” group to register as a voter once per account.__

![app-telos-net dao group view unregistered](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39388424/191971608-cc5a945e-1518-4fc8-b45a-0133fa4878be.png)

__Click the Register Button under Telos Governance Token__

This will request a signature of the Anchor Wallet, please confirm to add you to the Governance Token Group.
