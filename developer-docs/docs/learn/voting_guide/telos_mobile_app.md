As the overall logic of the Telos Decide System also applies to the Decide Voter app, you now need to join the “Telos Governance Token”. This option will only be visible if you did not join the group previously. If you have not joined, you may still explore Telos Governance but voting will fail.

From here you must sign the transaction using Anchor wallet.

Powering up your account (Optional) 

For those of you that have rarely interacted with the Telos Zero blockchain, either because you are jumping over from Telos EVM or just created a new account, you may have to add CPU, NET, or RAM to make it fully operational and gain access to the virtual feeless Telos network.

Insufficient resources may result in an error message. 
To resolve error messages visit the RAM & CPU & NET resource guides
- [How to manage RAM](../../zero/resource-management/ram.md)
- [How to manage CPU and NET](../../zero/resource-management/cpu-net.md).
