## Antelope versions

The subsequent tutorials are up to date with the following Antelope components.

| Component | Version |
| ------ | ------ |
| [Leap](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap) | 4.0.3 |
| [CDT](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/cdt) | 4.0.0 |
| [eos-system-contracts](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/eos-system-contracts) | 3.1.1 |

## Development Experience

Antelope based blockchains execute user-generated applications and code using WebAssembly (WASM). WASM is an emerging web standard with widespread support from Google, Microsoft, Apple, and industry leading companies.

At the moment the most mature toolchain for building applications that compile to WASM is clang/llvm with their C/C++ compiler. For best compatibility, it is recommended that you use the Antelope C++ toolchain.

Other toolchains in development by 3rd parties include: Rust, Python, and Solidity. While these other languages may appear simpler, their performance will likely impact the scale of application you can build. We expect that C++ will be the best language for developing high-performance and secure smart contracts and plan to use C++ for the foreseeable future.

## Operating System

The Antelope software supports the following environments for development and/or deployment:

* Ubuntu 18.04
* Ubuntu 20.04
* Ubuntu 22.04

__Note:__
 if you are developing on __Windows__, unfortunately we do not provide PowerShell ports and instructions at this time. In the future we may append PowerShell commands. In the mean-time your best bet is to use [DUNE](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/DUNE) or a VM with Ubuntu, and set up your development environment inside this VM. If you're an advanced Window's developer familiar with porting Linux instructions, you should encounter minimal issues.

### Command Line Knowledge

There are a variety of tools provided along with Antelope which requires you to have basic command line knowledge in order to interact with.

## Development Tools

We can use any text editor that, preferably, supports C++ syntax highlighting. Some of the popular editors are Sublime Text and Atom. Another option is an IDE, which provides a more sophisticated code completion and more complete development experience. You are welcome to use the software of your personal preference, but if you're unsure what to use we've provided some options for you to explore.
