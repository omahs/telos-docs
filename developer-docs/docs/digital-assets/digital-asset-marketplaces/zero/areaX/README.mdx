# AreaX NFT

## Getting Started on AreaX

[AreaX NFT](https://evm.areaxnft.com/) is a great marketplace to get familiar with. You can create, list and purchase Digital Assets with AreaX.  With AreaX you can even create and list your Digital Assets on the Telos Zero Chain.

To get started all you have to do is sign in.
1. Head over to their homepage.
2. Next to the  "Connect Wallet" button you can select if you'd like to view their EVM marketplace or Native one. (We are on the EVM one)

3. Once you're ready click "Connect Wallet" and sign with your wallet.
4. Then confirm by clicking the "Sign In" pop up! (While these screenshots where taken there was a slight typo that read "Sing In")
