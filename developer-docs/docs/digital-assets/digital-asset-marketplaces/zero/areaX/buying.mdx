# Creating an offer/ Buying Digital Assets on AreaX

There are a ton of Telos Digital Assets that we are sure will catch your eye! Let's now show you how to buy an Digital Asset listed or how you can make an offer on an Digital Asset that isn't for sale.

## Browse AreaX Digital Asset and find a collection or item you like.

1. Browse AreaX Digital Asset and find a collection or item you like.

If the item you're interested in is for sale you can press "Buy" but if it isn't listed you can also make an offer to the owner by clicking on "Make Offer".

2. Click "Buy" or "Make Offer".

If you&#39;re buying an Digital Asset you will then confirm in your wallet for the price it was listed for. But, if you&#39;re making an offer you have to select a few more things. We will show you that now!

3. After you selected &#39;Make Offer&#39; choose the price you want to offer.
4. Select the token type.
5. Chose when you want your offer to expire.
