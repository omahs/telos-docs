# Dr. Bill

Dr. Bill is a true visionary and OG in the generative art space.
"I have seen and explored many innovations in computer art over the past 50 years. When AI came along, I was naturally curious to see what all the hype was about. I started by experimenting with MidJourney, a popular AI art tool. I am excited to continue experimenting with AI art and to see what new possibilities it will open up in the future. I believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize the way we create art, and I am eager to be a part of that journey."
