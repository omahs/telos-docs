# Telos Zero

## Base Layer

[Antelope](https://antelope.io/) is the open-source software platform that Telos is built upon. Antelope is the backbone of Telos as it provides functionalities such as consensus, accounts, authentication, state storage, P2P communication, and the very powerful WASM runtime. Telos has established itself as a high-powered open source [Antelope](https://antelope.io/) chain and was the first to build an EVM on top of the Antelope IO base layer. WebAssembly provides a universal compile target that enables applications to be developed in any language. Currently, there are compilers for C, C++, RUST, and Typescript, catering to the needs of a diverse range of developers building smart contracts on the Telos Zero layers.

## TLOS Coin

TLOS is the native currency of Telos. The native Telos coin is vital for network governance and allocation of system resources, such as staking for annual returns in Resource Exchange (REX). TLOS is utilized to unlock network bandwidth to execute and interact with contracts, send tokens, and stake for network resources. TLOS is also used as the voting currency in on-chain governance. The total supply of TLOS is 420 million coins.

## Resource Overview

- **RAM:** A size-based resource an account can use to store data within smart contracts.
- **CPU:** A time-based resource an account uses while performing smart contract actions.
- **NET:** A size-based resource an account uses while sending data to the blockchain.

## Governance Overview

The Telos blockchain is a highly inclusive network. It comprises contributors such as node operators, builders, and users responsible for on-chain governance decisions with TLOS. To ensure transparent governance and decentralization, Telos created the Telos Decide Governance Engine, a system designed to support on-chain voting with TLOS and any user-created tokens. Via Telos Decide, the token holders contribute to decisions around upgrading the Telos Zero and EVM protocol, voting on Block Producers, proposals, amendments, and elections.
