# Fees

Currently, Telos Zero transactions have no fees. Telos Zero fees are set by block producers and voted by token holders.

EVM transactions will have a fee model similar to [the native Ethereum gas model](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/). The Ethereum account needs to have TLOS token to pay for the transaction. [Telos EVM fees](../../evm/about/gas-fees.md) are expected to be < 0.1% of Ethereum gas fees for identical transactions.

The table provides a summary of four mainstream blockchains with its respective pricing (fees) model.

| **Blockchain**      | **Fee model**                                            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Telos               | Free on Zero & minimal on tEVM, settable by governance |
| Ethereum            | Very high ($30 for a token transfer)                     |
| Binance Smart Chain | Dictated by Binance                                      |
| Polygon             | ?                                                        |

At the time of writing this document, the fee model for Polygon could not be established.
